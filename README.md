This repository contains a Streamlit application that simulates and visualizes real-time data for an electric vehicle (EV) fleet. The dashboard displays key metrics such as state-of-charge (SOC), voltage, current, speed, temperature, gradient, and the predicted range based on a machine learning model. It also integrates an interactive map showing EV charging stations in Kenya using Pydeck.
